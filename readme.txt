To launch the recommender system, run the command line interface file.

This can be done by calling: python3 cli.py

Alternatively, if Python 3 is the default installation on your local machine: python cli.py

Usage instructions:

Running the cli.py script will launch the CLI interface, prompting you to select an active user. You will then be asked to complete a brief questionnaire before recommendations are generated. 5 recommendations will be listed on the screen with corresponding similarity scores/predicted rankings and explainability information. You will subsequently be prompted to generate a new set of recommendations, modify the active user, or quit the program.
